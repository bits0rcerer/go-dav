## Notice

- This server is meant to run behind a reverse proxy which should take care of SSL
- This server trusts all common proxy headers

> [NOTE](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gorilla/handlers?utm_source=godoc#ProxyHeaders): This middleware should only be
> used when behind a reverse proxy like nginx, HAProxy or Apache. Reverse proxies that don't (or are configured not to)
> strip these headers from client requests, or where these headers are accepted "as is" from a remote client (e.g. when
> Go
> is not behind a proxy), can manifest as a vulnerability if your application uses these headers for validating the '
> trustworthiness' of a request.
